# Stage 2 of the PR approval-labeling workflow. Runs in the base-repo context
# (triggered by workflow_run) so it has a write GITHUB_TOKEN, even when the
# original review was on a fork PR.
#
# The PR number is read from an artifact uploaded by Stage 1 and treated as
# untrusted — review state is always re-queried from the GitHub API.
