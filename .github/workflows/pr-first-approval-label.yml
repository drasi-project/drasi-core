# Stage 1 of a two-stage workflow. The pull_request_review event runs with a
# read-only GITHUB_TOKEN for fork PRs, so this workflow only saves the PR
# number as an artifact. The privileged labeling logic lives in
# pr-first-approval-label-run.yml, which triggers via workflow_run and
# executes in the base-repo context with write permissions.
